Read `mydata.json` and help me update specific sections:

1. Show current content structure
2. Ask which section to update (projects, experience, skills, testimonials, about, contact, etc.)
3. Guide me through updating the data with proper formatting
4. Validate JSON syntax after changes
5. Show a preview of what changed

Make sure to:
- Preserve existing JSON formatting
- Maintain data structure consistency
- Validate all URLs and paths
- Check for required fields
